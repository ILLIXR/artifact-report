\section{Artifact Appendix}

\subsection{Abstract}

The artifacts consist of the ILLIXR system, test applications, and results scripts.

\subsection{Artifact check-list (meta-information)}

{\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Program: } ILLIXR, Monado, test applications, ILLIXR results scripts.
  \item {\bf Compilation: } Make 4.2, clang 10.0, CUDA 11.1, Python 3.8 (included in install scripts)
  \item {\bf Data set: } See \S IIIC (included in artifact) and \S IIID (downloaded by program).
  \item {\bf Run-time environment: } Ubuntu 18.04 + install scripts.
  \item {\bf Hardware: } Any x86-64 system with CUDA can run, but one needs the hardware in \S IIIA for exact repeatability.
  \item {\bf Output: } \texttt{results/output/*} and \texttt{results/Graphs/*}.
  \item {\bf Experiments: } For each hardware platform, for each app, run ILLIXR.
  \item {\bf How much disk space required: } 5Gb, including downloaded datasets
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to prepare workflow: } 1 hour
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to complete experiments: } 20 minutes per hardware platform
  \item {\bf Publicly available: } Yes, see archive URL.
  \item {\bf Code licenses: } The system licensed under NCSA. Each component is licensed under one of: ElasticFusion License, NCSA, MIT, Simplified BSD, LGPL v3.0, LGPL v2.1, Boost Software License v1.0, GPL v3.0. See {\footnotesize \url{https://github.com/ILLIXR/ILLIXR/\#licensing-structure}}
  \item {\bf Data licenses: } Each dataset is licensed under one of: proprietary, ElasticFusion License, Creative Commons 0.
  \item {\bf Archived (provide DOI): } \zenodo
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Description}

\subsubsection{How to access}

One can find the version we used for this paper here (\zenodo), and a rolling release here ({\footnotesize \url{https://github.com/ILLIXR/}}). We suggest using the rolling release, unless exact repeatability is desired.

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}

One can find the hardware we used for this paper in \S IIIA. ILLIXR will still work on a generic x86-64 Ubuntu system, but the results may not be exactly repeatable.

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

{
\footnotesize
\begin{minted}{shell}
./ILLIXR/install\_deps.sh
python3 -m pip install poetry
sudo apt-get install build-essential scons pkg-config \
  libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libgl1-mesa-dev \
  libglu-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libudev-dev \
  libxi-dev libxrandr-dev yasm
scons -C godot -j$(nproc) platform=x11 target=release_debug
cd results/analysis; poetry install; cd ../..
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
\end{minted}
}

See our online documentation for more details:\newline
{\footnotesize \url{https://illixr.github.io/ILLIXR/getting_started}}

\subsubsection{Data sets}

The software pulls required datasets automatically at runtime.

\subsection{Installation}

Not applicable.

\subsection{Experiment workflow}

First, we have to compile each application:

{
\footnotesize
\begin{minted}{shell}
for app_path in OpenXR-Apps/*; do
  ./godot/bin/godot.x11.opt.tools.64
  # Import project (project.godot) (fig 1)
  # Export project (fig 2)
  # Select "Linux (Runnable)" (fig 3)
  # Select Custom Template="./godot/bin/godot.x11.opt.tools.64"
  # Select Export Path="./OpenXR-Apps/$app/bin"
  # Where app is replaced by $app shorname (e.g. "sponza")
done
\end{minted}
}

Then, we run each application:

{\scriptsize
\begin{minted}{shell}
hardware=""
# manually set to one of "jetsonlp", "jetsonhp", "desktop"
for app_path in OpenXR-Apps/*; do
  app=$(basename ${app_path})
  cmd="./ILLIXR/runner.sh ILLIXR/configs/${app}.yaml"
  ${cmd}
  nvidia-smi -q --display=UTILIZATION,POWER,TEMPERATURE \
    --loop-ms=200
  perf stat -e power/energy-cores/,power/energy-pkg/,power/energy-ram/ \
    -- ${cmd}
  mv ILLIXR/metrics results/metrics/metrics-${hardware}-${app}
done
\end{minted}
}

To switch between high- and low-power mode on Jetson

{\small
\begin{minted}{shell}
sudo jetson_clocks --restore ${lp_or_hp}_mode.txt
\end{minted}
}

\subsection{Evaluation and expected results}

Make sure to synchronize the \texttt{results/metrics/} directory from all hardware platforms onto the desktop before continuing. On the desktop, run

{\footnotesize
\begin{minted}{shell}
cd results/analysis
poetry run python3 main.py
\end{minted}
}

The output from our run is available in \texttt{metrics-snapshot} and our graphs are available in \texttt{Graphs-snapshot}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fig 3 is {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/fps-jlp/jhp/desktop.pdf}}
\item Fig 4 is {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/timeseries-platformer-desktop-1.pdf}} and {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/timeseries-platformer-desktop-2.pdf}}
\item Fig 5 is {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/cpu-breakdown.pdf}}
\item Fig 6 is {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/power-total.pdf}} and\newline {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/power-breakdown.pdf}}
\item Fig 7 is {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/mtp-platformer.pdf}}
\item Fig 8 is {\footnotesize\texttt{results/Graphs/microarchitecture.pdf}}
\end{itemize}

To replicate Table IV and V, see \texttt{ILLIXR-Evaluation/README.md}. The output from our run of this script is available at \texttt{ILLIXR\_SSIM\_FLIP}.

\subsection{Experiment customization}

Here are cutomizations we anticipate:

\begin{itemize}
\item Modify or add your own app to \texttt{ILLIXR/app/*}.
\item Add your own analysis pass to \texttt{results/analysis/*.py}
\item Add your own plugin to the ILLIXR system in \texttt{ILLIXR/*}. See our online documentation for details:\newline
{\footnotesize \url{https://illixr.github.io/ILLIXR/writing_your_plugin/}}
\end{itemize}
